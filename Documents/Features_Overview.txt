MailCrafter - Your Smart Email Customization and Automation Solution

-- Core features

Multi-Email Integration
Users can integrate multiple email accounts with the app, using app passwords for secure and delegated email sending. This allows centralized management of all their email communications from one platform.

Customizable Email Templates
Create and save personalized email templates that can be reused for different purposes. Each template can be customized with dynamic placeholders to insert personalized content for recipients, saving time while keeping communication personalized.

Custom Group Management
MailCrafer allows users to create customized groups for sending emails. Each group can contain multiple properties (such as name, job title, or location) that can be inserted as references in email templates, ensuring that each recipient receives tailored communication.

Excel File Import for Group Management
Users can upload Excel files from their local device to create or update contact groups. MailCrafter will automatically parse the data from the file, allowing users to map columns to specific group properties (e.g., name, email, company, custom attributes). This feature simplifies the process of managing large contact lists and ensures seamless integration of offline data into MailCrafter's group system.
-- Auto-Mapping: MailCrafter can suggest automatic mapping for common column names (like "First Name", "Email", etc.) or allow users to manually map fields.
-- Data Validation: The system can validate the imported data, checking for duplicates or missing required fields, and provide feedback for corrections before creating or updating groups.

Property-Based Personalization
Groups can include custom attributes, which can be referenced in the email templates. For instance, using placeholders like "{firstName}" or "{company}" in the templates will automatically fill in relevant details for each recipient, making emails more engaging and targeted.
